# hello-world

Hi Folks!

As an aspiring developer, I am currently focusing on learning Python as my chosen programming language, and in parallel I am studying the theory of programming (OPP, functional programming), including popular development methodologies and techniques (Agile, Scrum). In addition I have basic understanding of the following programming languages / technologies: Ruby, Javascript, JQuery,  HTML/CSS, XML.

I am interested in machine learning, AI, deep learing and many more areas in software development.
